# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-of-Cyber-Security-Breaches
Overview
This project involves performing an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing information about cyber security breaches.
The goal is to clean the data, visualize key features, and uncover insights that can help organizations understand the landscape of cyber threats.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is titled "Cyber Security Breaches.csv" and contains various attributes related to cyber security incidents.
The data set is adopted from kaggle

Steps Involved
1. Data Cleaning
Handling Missing Values: Missing values were filled using forward fill method.
Removing Duplicates: Duplicate entries were removed to ensure data integrity.
2. Data Visualization
Histograms: Created to visualize the distribution of numerical features.
Count Plots: Used to visualize the frequency of categorical features.
Correlation Heatmap: Generated to explore relationships between numerical variables.
Pair Plots: Visualized pairwise relationships among numerical features.
Box Plots: Created to detect outliers in numerical features.
Libraries Used
numpy: For numerical operations.
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
matplotlib: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
seaborn: For statistical data visualization.
How to Run the Code
Clone the repository.
Ensure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using:
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
Update the file path in the code to point to the "Cyber Security Breaches.csv" file.
Run the script to see the visualizations and insights.
Conclusion
This project highlights the importance of data analysis in understanding cyber security threats. The visualizations provide valuable insights that can aid organizations in their security strategies.
